## Hello!
My name is Eric and I am a junior CS student and a first-year student at EWU.

I am an artist and self-taught programmer, with primary interests in graphic programming and C++! I have built a number of apps and games as personal projects, but I'm excited to take classes to solidify my knowledge!
